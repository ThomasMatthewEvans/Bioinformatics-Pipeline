# Bioinformatics-Pipeline
Bioinformatics pipeline  
Using biopython and Entrez to get and analyse data from the NCBI
Aim is to create multiple scripts that can be used interchangeably to get amd analyze data

Details of each script is given below;

1 Litriture Searcher
Searches papers and spits out results
Used in combination with a macros excell file to format nicely

2 Disease Name to Gene
input a csv or a list, output as a csv or a list TODO TODO TODO

todo
Gene to sequence etc

3 Sequence analyser 
Used to manipulate sequences. Input as a csv TODO or a list, creates multiple operatioms on the sequence analyser


Small Methods Used to Streamline Projects

1 - mergeCSVFiles
Used to merge a numberof CSV files based on the files alone. No formatting just pastes the second file onto the end of the first file.
